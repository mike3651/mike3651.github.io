<h1 class="align-center">Graphs</h1>
<p>What is a graph? A graph is a set of vertices all linked together by a set of edges. Graphs are not very difficult to find in the real world. We find them when we network with people to see who we know, routing between cities to see how long it takes to get from one city to another, tournament brackets to see what teams play what and several other areas in life.</p>

<h2>Common graphs</h2>
<ul>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Simple</span>: Each edge connects two different vertices and no two edges connect the same pair of vertices.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Multigraph</span>: A graph in which there can be multiple edges connecting the same vertices.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Pseudograph</span>: Graph that can include loop and multiple edges to other vertices or to a single vertex.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Undirected</span>: Graph in which the each edge doesn't care as to what the start or endpoint vertices.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Directed</span>: Each edge is associated with an ordered pair of vertices. Such that Edge(u,v) \(\neq\) Edge(v,u).</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Simple directed</span>: Directed graph with no loops nor multiple edges.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Directed multigraph</span>: Directed graph that contains multiple directed edges.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Mixed</span>: Graph which contains directed and undirected edges.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Bipartite</span>: Graph in which its edges can be separated into two sets such that \(V_1, V_2 \subset V\) and no two vertices \(v_i\in V_1, v_i\in V_2 where i >= 1\) are connected to one another.</li>
   <li class="external"><span class="keyword">Complete</span>: Simple graph that where there is only one edge connecting each pair of distinct vertices</li>   
</ul>

<h2>Graphing algorithms you should know</h2>

<h3>Depth First Search</h3>
<pre>
<code>
Goes through all of the nodes in a graph
input: The node to start at
output: None

DFS(startingNode)
   create a stack of type node
   add starting node to the stack
   while stack is not empty
      pop node from the stack and mark as visited
      for each neighbor of popped node
         if neighbor is not visited
            add neighbor to the stack
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Breadth First Search</h3>
<pre>
<code>
Goes through all of the nodes in a graph
input: The node to start at
output: None

BFS(startingNode)
   create a queue of type node
   add starting node to the queue
   while queue is not empty
      remove node from the stack and mark as visited
      for each neighbor of remove node
         if neighbor is not visited
            add neighbor to the queue
</code>
</pre>


<h3>Bipartite coloring</h3>
<pre>
<code>
Colors a graph in such a way that the colors represent a subset
input: graph G where g is any sort of graph
output: colored graph if it is possible to make a bipartite

makeBipartite(G)
   colorCount is 0
   for each Vertex v in list of vertices
      colorCount is odd ? color is red : color is blue
         if v is not colored
            v->color = color
         else if v->color is not equal to color
            return 
         colorCount is odd ? color is blue : color is red
         for each neighbor of v
            if n is not colored
               n->color = color
            else 
               return

<h2>Useful definitions &amp; theorems</h2>
<h3>Neighbors of a subset of vertices</h3>
<p>Assuming that A is a subset of V and v is a vertex in V, we can represent the neighbors in the subset A is: <br>
	\(N(A) = \cup_{v \in A}N(v)\)
</p>
<h3>Easy check for nonIsomorphism</h3>
<p>If the maximum degree in either graph H or G are different then the two graphs are not isomorphic. In order for the graphs to be isomorphic there must exists a one-to-one function such that if vertex a &amp; b are adjacent in G then f(a) &amp; f(b) are adjacent in H</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ul>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Loop</span>: A vertex which has an edge to itself.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Neighbor</span>: A vertex which is connected to another unique vertex.</li>
   <li class="external"><span class="keyword">Isomorphism</span>: You can translate one graph into another one.</li>
</ul>
