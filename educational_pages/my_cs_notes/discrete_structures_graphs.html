<h1 class="align-center">Graphs</h1>
<p>What is a graph? A graph is a set of vertices all linked together by a set of edges. Graphs are not very difficult to find in the real world. We find them when we network with people to see who we know, routing between cities to see how long it takes to get from one city to another, tournament brackets to see what teams play what and several other areas in life.</p>

<h2>Common graphs</h2>
<ul>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Simple</span>: Each edge connects two different vertices and no two edges connect the same pair of vertices.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Multigraph</span>: A graph in which there can be multiple edges connecting the same vertices.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Pseudograph</span>: Graph that can include loop and multiple edges to other vertices or to a single vertex.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Undirected</span>: Graph in which the each edge doesn't care as to what the start or endpoint vertices.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Directed</span>: Each edge is associated with an ordered pair of vertices. Such that Edge(u,v) \(\neq\) Edge(v,u).</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Simple directed</span>: Directed graph with no loops nor multiple edges.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Directed multigraph</span>: Directed graph that contains multiple directed edges.</li>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Mixed</span>: Graph which contains directed and undirected edges.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ul>
	<li class="external"><span class="keyword">Loop</span>: A vertex which has an edge to itself.</li>
</ul>
