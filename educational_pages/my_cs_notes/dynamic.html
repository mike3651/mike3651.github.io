<h2>Rod cutting</h2>
<p></p>
<pre>
<code>
input: 
	n -> The length of the rod 
	P[0..n] -> The prices that correspond to the lengths of the given rod
output:
	The maximum price that can be attained with such a length and what cutes need to be made
Rod cutting algorithm(P[0..n])
	S[0..n] -> an array that keeps track of cuts needed in order to maximize the price of the rod cuts
	for i from [1:n]:
		currMax = negative max -> current maximum value that we can attain for a certina suub length of the rod
		for j in [1:i]:
			if p[i] + s[i - j] > q:
				currMax = p[j] + s[i - j]
				s[i] = currMax
	return s, s[n]
